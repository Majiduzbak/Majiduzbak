## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Majid, and I hold a Cand.Scient degree in physics with specialising in Astrophysics.
This git repository will be updated by time, were I will be adding the projects I have done during my work and degree.

### MSc-project
The most recent project I have done is during my master's degree, were I did a two step project. 
Firstly a prep-project and later on my actual master's degree, I build on this project in more depth and details.
This project was a collaboration with two other peers, Which I will link to their git-repositories.

#### The project: Investigating physical parameters of protostellar Systems. 
(With integrating, observational, simulations and machine learning methods)
